# TextintoData
Works by (and related to) Paul the Deacon

Included in this repository:

PaulOrigoLat.xml and PaulOrigoEng.xml – the final XML versions of Paul's Latin text, which are uploaded to Philologic (https://marat.uchicago.edu/philologic/TextData/)

PaulLemma and PaulLemmaNOTLogeion – text files of the results of loading PaulOrigoLat.xml into LatinLexicon and Logeion SQLite and running queries

ÆlfricVitaeMaryEngl.xml – XML version of an out-of-copyright Modern English translation of a chapter from Ælfric's Lives of Saints. This chapter is not itself by Ælfric, but is insterted into the manuscript with his writings, and is a faithful (imo) translation of Paul the Deacon's "Vita Sanctae Mariae Egyptiacae."

ÆlfricVitaeMaryOldEngl.xml - XML version edited from a dirty OCR (AelfricOldEnglishDirtyOCR.pdf, included in this repository for a sense of the extent of the editing necessary). The editing process was a lesson in patience, the power of Regular Expressions, and being mindful of the scope of RegEx replacements. 

Next steps for this repository would include creating a TEI-formatted XML file of Paul's "Vita Sanctae Mariae Egyptiacae" and sourcing a version of the Greek original from which Paul himself was working, but having considered the versions of these texts currently avaliable online (and knowing the time correction would take, after doing the Old English version, which is currently the only XML in this repository not built from HTML-formatted text), this will be a longer-term project.
